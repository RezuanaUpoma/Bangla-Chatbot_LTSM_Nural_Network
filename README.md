# Bangla-Chatbot_LTSM_Nural_Network
# Bangla Chatbot Using LSTM

This project demonstrates the development of a Bangla chatbot using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We created a custom Bangla dataset to train the chatbot for effective communication in the Bangla language.

## Project Overview

The Bangla chatbot is built using an LSTM-based neural network to handle natural language understanding and generation. The project includes the following key components:
- **Custom Bangla Dataset**: A dataset created specifically for training the chatbot with Bangla language data.
- **LSTM Model**: The core neural network model used for training and generating responses.
- **Chatbot Interface**: A simple interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Features

- **Bangla Language Support**: The chatbot is designed to understand and respond in Bangla.
- **Custom Dataset**: We developed our own dataset to improve the chatbot's performance and relevance.
- **LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes LSTM networks to handle sequential data and generate coherent responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the chatbot and LSTM model.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Libraries used for building and training the LSTM model.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for processing text data.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.

## Dataset

The custom Bangla dataset consists of conversational pairs to train the chatbot. It includes various topics and responses to provide a broad understanding of the language.
